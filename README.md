# Listening Party Web

This project is a web-based listening party platform where users can create and join virtual rooms to listen to music together with friends and other users. The application utilizes the Spotify API to play music, allowing users to add tracks to the room's playlist, skip songs, and interact while listening.

## Key Features

### Room Creation and Joining
Users can create their own listening rooms or join existing ones.

### Real-Time Music Playback
Utilizing the Spotify API, music is played in real-time for all participants in the room.

### Adding and Removing Songs
Users can add songs to the room's playback queue or remove songs from the queue.

### Song Skipping
Room participants have the option to skip a song, advancing to the next one in the queue.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
Developed using React.js to create an interactive and responsive user interface.

### Backend
Built with Django and Django Rest Framework to create RESTful APIs for managing rooms, users, and interactions.

### Integration with Spotify API
Utilization of the Spotify API to search for and play music on the platform.

### This project is ongoing.
